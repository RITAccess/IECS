This repository is where we are storing materials for the Inclusive Exploring Computer Science program that is held at Rochester Institute of Technology.  The first run of the program occured during the 2013 summer. 

Inclusive Exploring Computer Science is an adaptation of the Exploring Computer Science program, with an emphasis on making the material more accessible to students that have visual impairments.
